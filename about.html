                <h2>A Brief History of the Keeks</h2>  
                <p>Kiku was born on Mother's Day, 2011, in a bathroom. We didn't think her mother could have kittens, so Kiku and her sister were surprises, to say the least. We rehomed her sister, but I was able to keep Kiku, and we've been besties ever since. She used to be very skittish, but with a lot of TLC, she has come out of her shell and will gladly accept attention from anyone who wishes to bestow it upon her.</p>

                <h2>What is Kiku Up To Now?</h2>
                <p>Anything she darn well pleases. She is an old lady, but still enjoys chasing ribbons, scratching her cardboard scratchers, and making a nuisance of herself whenever someone doesn't share their tuna. Her hobbies also include napping, yelling, and supervising our resident IT man.</p>
